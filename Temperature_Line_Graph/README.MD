# Weekly Temperature Line Graph

## 📋 Task Description

**Objective:**  
Create a Python program that plots a line graph representing daily temperature readings over the course of a week.

**Temperature Data (in °C):**  
`[20, 22, 19, 23, 21, 24, 20]`

**Days of the Week:**  
`['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']`

---

## 📈 Output

The program generates a **line graph** that visually represents temperature fluctuations throughout the week, with the following features:

- Blue line connecting temperature points for each day
- Circular markers (`o`) on each data point
- Grid lines for better readability
- Clear labels for both axes
- A descriptive and bold title
